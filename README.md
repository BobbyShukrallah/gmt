A module for making illustrations for my geometric measure theory class. It defines "Ball" and "Cube" objects and other helper functions that make it easier to translate some mathematical proofs into readable algorthms.

Also included are Jupyter notebooks where I show how I generated figures using this module and matplotlib.
